  bio: |+
    <br />
    I’m Yao, and I’m a PhD candidate in the department of sociology at The Ohio State University. I conduct research on the formation and persistency of status inequality, with a particular focus on the intersection between gender and race/ethnicity. My work draws heavily on cultural sociology, social psychology, and sociology of education. I leverage multiple methodological approaches, such as survey experiment, secondary survey analysis, computational text analysis, and qualitative interview, to answer my research questions.

    <br />
    Prior coming to the U.S., I spent my first 18 years in a small city called Enshi on the mountainous southwestern corner of Hubei province, China. In the next six years, I lived in Beijing and received a M.A. in Anthropology and B.A. in Sociology, both from Renmin University of China. During this period, I conducted ethnographic work in a migrant school on the outskirts of Beijing for three years.
