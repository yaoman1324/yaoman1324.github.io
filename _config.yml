  bio: |+
    My name is Man Yao, and I usually go by Yao. I'm a quantitative sociologist and an assistant professor of Women's and Gender Studies at <a href="https://denison.edu/people/man-yao">Denison University</a>. I'm also affiliated with Denison's <a href="https://denison.edu/academics/data-analytics">Data Analytics Program</a> and <a href="https://denison.edu/academics/east-asian-studies">East Asian Studies Program</a>. I received my PhD degree from the <a href="https://sociology.osu.edu/">Department of Sociology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>. You could find my updated CV <a href="https://yaoman1324.github.io/assets/files/Yao_CV.pdf">here</a>.

    <br />
    My research explores the persistence of gender inequality in contemporary societies, with a particular focus on how cultural notions of femininity and masculinity are constructed and perpetuated in the digital age. I combine computational techniques with traditional social science methods to investigate these dynamics. <br />    
    <br />
    I grew up in a small city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshi_Tujia_and_Miao_Autonomous_Prefecture">Enshi</a> on the mountainous southwestern corner of Hubei province, China. Then, I lived in Beijing and received a M.A. in Anthropology and B.A. in Sociology, both from <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en">Renmin University of China</a>. During this period, I conducted ethnographic work in an elementary school for migrant children on the outskirts of Beijing for three years.
