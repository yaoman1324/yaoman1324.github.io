  bio: |+
    <br />
    I’m Yao, and I’m a PhD candidate in the department of sociology at The Ohio State University. I conduct research on the formation and persistency of gender inequality, with a particular focus on the role of cultural beliefs. My dissertation looks at how people in the U.S. perceive the gender meanings of unfamiliar Chinese names. My work draws heavily on cultural sociology, social psychology, and sociology of education. I leverage multiple methodological approaches, such as survey experiment, secondary survey analysis, computational text analysis, and qualitative interview, to answer my research questions. You could find my updated CV <a href="https://yaoman1324.github.io/assets/files/Yao_CV_july.22.pdf">here</a>.

    Prior coming to the U.S., I spent my first 18 years in a small city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshi_Tujia_and_Miao_Autonomous_Prefecture">Enshi</a> on the mountainous southwestern corner of Hubei province, China. In the next six years, I lived in Beijing and received a M.A. in Anthropology and B.A. in Sociology, both from Renmin University of China. During this period, I conducted ethnographic work in an elementary school for migrant children on the outskirts of Beijing for three years.

    In leisure time, I’m a pop music fan and enjoy studying the lyrics and going to concerts. I also love singing and playing guitar and piano.
