> Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement—when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it’s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won’t matter how successful you become or who is in your life—you won’t enjoy any of it.  - **Sam Harris, Waking Up**


<br />

Here's the truth: life can be difficult regardless of who you are.  We live in a tumultuous time. We are living in the dawn of catastrophic climate change, political instability, and widening inequality.  Even if you're fortunate enough to have your material needs met, there is no escaping the existential, mental, and spiritual struggle that comes with living your life. Nihilism has never been more tempting. We joke so much about our "first world problems," yet stress-related health issues, anxiety disorders, and cases of depression have skyrocketed over the past thirty years.

So it's safe to say that our minds take a beating just by living every day, even for those of us that are not a part of any marginalized identities.  And although it is generally standard practice to exercise so that our bodies can take the physical stressors from day-to-day life, it is not so common to do the same for our mental well-being.  Part of this issue is cultural.  Outside of meds and expensive therapy, the west has not had a long tradition of practices or rituals for our mental health.  In fact, since the introduction of SSRIs in the 1970s, drug development for treating depression & anxiety has stalled. The drugs (like SSRIs) that exist have shown troubling signs that the effectiveness wanes over time.

I believe Meditation, a practice developed in Asia over centuries, is part of the answer to promoting mental well-being.  Of course, it is now gaining scientific recognition as well.  That said, I don't want to oversell it. Meditation practice is one of the most challenging things I've ever done.
But it has been the most rewarding thing I've done in my life.
