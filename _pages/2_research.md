## **Gender Beliefs in Interpersonal Relationships**

My current research aims to deepen our understandings of how gender beliefs are endorsed, diffused, activated, and maintained in interpersonal relationships.

* My dissertation examines how people in the U.S. perceive gender meanings of **Chinese names** written in English letters and its consequences in everyday life. I argue that the association between first name and sex category serves as a pervasive cultural schema, which can shape perceptions about seemingly gender-neural names (e.g., Chinese names) and create unequal outcomes in daily life. More details about my study on names can be found [here](https://yaoman1324.github.io/names/).

* In another ongoing project, I examine how gender intersects with the racialized belief about people with East Asian origins of lacking warmth and assertiveness impact their labor market outcomes.

## **Gender Inequality in Higher Education**

In this line of research, I use population-level survey data to document gender inequalities in a diverse range of outcomes in China and the U.S., particulaly in the setting of higher education.
