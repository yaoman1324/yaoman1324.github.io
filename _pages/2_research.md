## **Gender Categoriztion and Stereotypes**

Currently I am exploring how gender categorization and stereotypes are constructed and used in daily interactions, with a particular focus on the intersectionality between gender and race/ethnicity.

* My dissertation examines how people in the U.S. perceive gender meanings of **Chinese names** written in English letters and its consequences in everyday life. I argue that the association between first name and sex category serves as a pervasive cultural schema, which can shape perceptions about seemingly gender-neutral Chinese names and create unequal outcomes in daily life.

* In another ongoing project, I examine how gender intersects with the racialized belief about people with East Asian origins of lacking warmth and assertiveness impact their labor market outcomes.

## **Gender Inequality in Education and Work**

In this line of research, I use population-level survey data to document progress and continiuing impediment of gender equality in a diverse range of outcomes in China and the U.S.
