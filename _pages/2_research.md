## Status Beliefs and Social Stratification

My current research aims to deepen our understandings of how cultural beliefs shape social stratification. I'm particulaly interested in how status beliefs based on group differences (e.g., gender and race/ethnicity) are endorsed, diffused, activated, and maintained in interpersonal relationships.

* My dissertation examines how people in the U.S. perceive gender meanings of **Chinese names** written in English letters and its consequences in everyday life. I argue that people's names as gender and race/ethnicity cues play crucial roles in activating status beliefs and create cumulative mental and social consequences in daily life. More details about my study on names can be founded [here](https://yaoman1324.github.io/names/).
* In another ongoing project, I examine how racialized beliefs about people with East Asian origins of lacking warmth and assertiveness impact their labor market outcomes.

## Documenting Gender Inequalities in Higher Education

In this line of research, I use population-level survey data to document gender inequalities in a diverse range of outcomes in China and the U.S., particulaly in the setting of higher education.
