**Updates**
I'm still a first year (have not passed prelims) so there's I'm mostly taking coursework before I start research.


**Current Research Interests**

This is subject to change but I'm interested in the intersection between spatial statistics & small area estimation, from a Bayesian perspective. I'm interested in primary application to ecology, climatology, or civic data.

This is [my past proposal to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpw5oFMn0PoQASQzgQi3S8hd_bE1fk63/view?usp=sharing).

I did not win but got Honorable Mention... which is almost worst than getting rejected. lol

Here are some papers I find very interesting:
* [The Two Cultures for Prevalence Mapping: Small Area Estimation and Spatial Statistics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09576.pdf)
* [Review of Nonstationary Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02447)
* [A Case Study Competition Among Methods for Analyzing Large Spatial Data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-018-00348-w)
* [Meta-kriging: Scalable Bayesian modeling and inference for massive spatial datasets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00401706.2018.1437474)
