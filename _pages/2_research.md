### I. Activation, Maintenence, and Consequences of Status Beliefs

My current research aims to deepen our understandings of how cultural beliefs shape social stratification. I'm particulaly interested in how status beliefs based on group differences (e.g., gender and race/ethnicity) are endorsed, diffused, activated, and maintained in interpersonal relationships.

* My dissertation examines how people in the U.S. perceive gender meanings of **Chinese names** written in English letters and its consequences in everyday life. I argue that people's names as gender and race/ethnicity cues play crucial roles in activating status beliefs and create cumulative mental and social consequences in daily life. More details about my study on names can be founded here.
* In another ongoing project, I examine how racialized beliefs about people with East Asian origins of lacking warmth and assertiveness impact their labor market outcomes.

### II. Documenting Gender Inequalities in Higher Educatin

In this line of research, I use population-level survey data to document gender inequalities in a diverse range of outcomes in China and the U.S., particulaly in the setting of higher education.

* My master thesis investigated gender differences in post-college planning among China's recent college students. It sheds lights on how Chinese women's career pathway are constrained by gendered academic experience and family expectations, despite their tremendous progress in education.
* Another project (with Tori Rehr and Erica Regan) used large-scale survey data to document the widespread gender gap in financial knowledge among college students in the U.S., a potential driver of gender wealth gap.
