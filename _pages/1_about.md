For a professional summary please [see my resume](/resume/).

People often describe me as energetic, funny, and outgoing. I love traveling, cooking, practicing meditation, and spending time with my girlfriend Laura.   I'm also blessed to have many friends and a loving family.   

Recently, I've really gotten into playing softball and gardening.  I try to balance my career with being a happy human.

Currently, I see *statistics* as my way of contributing (very small pieces) toward solutions to important societal problems through my career. I also believe that volunteering is super important because it's hard to get paid to fix systemic issues.

#### My Life Path

Long story short: I've been incredibly blessed.

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1]. This is why my mom and I are both dual-citizens[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots while being immersed a culture that is so different was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up on the beautiful island of O'ahu.**  There's a saying that goes like: "you can take a person out of Hawai'i but you can't take Hawai'i out of a person".  I think this is true.  Hawaii is a very nurturing place with a laid-back communalism that doesn't stifle individuality.  

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I had a blast at the Waldorf High School in Sacramento and a gentle introduction to the Mainland.  Took a 1/2 gap year to work on a political campaign which really connected me to Sacramento.

**East Bay.** I went to UC Berkeley intending to go into environmental law. But a talk with an environmental lawyer changed my mind.
I took stats, decided to major in it but I was mostly interested in clean energy. I took more energy-related classes than stats.   After college, I worked for various clean energy companies while living in Oakland.

**A trip of a lifetime.** In 2019, I was let go from what I thought was my dream job, had a quarter life crisis, and went on a "fuck it" trip to SE Asia. This turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life. I also met Laura when I came back to Oakland.

**Back in Sacramento.** I moved back with Laura right before the pandemic. I worked at the CA Dept. of Healthcare Services as a Data Analyst.  My time at the State Government made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills contributing in civil service.

**Now:** Trying to become a bona-fide statistician.  Pursuing my PhD at UC Santa Cruz.
